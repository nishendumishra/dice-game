# dice-game
Basically this a Dice game in which there are two players who are given one die each and with every refresh of the website they throw the dice and the player who threw the die with the greater number on it wins.

## HTML Used
In the HTML file there is one container which contains two divs having class dice and an image of dice. 
Using the script tag I have linked the javascipt file.

## CSS Used 
In the CSS file, I have given different sizes and display properties with text decorations and font styles and some other functionalities.

In Javascript, a randomNumber1 is a variable which is used to generate a random number from 0 to 5.
## The functions used are:
### Math.random()
### Math.floor()
